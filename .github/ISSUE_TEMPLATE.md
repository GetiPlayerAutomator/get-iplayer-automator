What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

What version of GiA are you using? On what version of OS X?

Are you using a web proxy? DNS proxy? VPN? VPS?

What programme are you attempting to download (full title, series and episode)? **Provide only ONE programme as an example. DO NOT list multiple programmes.**

If GiA crashes, provide the OS X crash log by copying the information from Crash Reporter into a file or locating the crash log in `$HOME/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports`.
